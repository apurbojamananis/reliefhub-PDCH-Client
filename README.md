## Technology Stack

- **React**: The core technology utilized for building the user interface components in the project. React was instrumental in creating dynamic and interactive views, including the home/landing page, supply detail page, login/register pages, and dashboard.

- **Redux**: Integrated into the project for efficient state management. Redux facilitated the centralized storage and management of application state, including supply data, user authentication status, and statistical insights displayed on the dashboard.
